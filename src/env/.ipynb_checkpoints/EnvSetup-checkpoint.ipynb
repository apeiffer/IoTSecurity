    "The purpose of this notebook is to define an IoT network using the `networkx` package. For this study, we are interested in the idea that devices can manipulate data transmitted in packets as it is being forwarded from a source device to a destination device. This would result in incorrect data arriving at the destination device. This may happen intentionally or unintentionally. We refer to these types of devices as malicious, because they can compromise the integrity of the packets that are sent throughout the network. The code used to create the networks is exported to `./IoTgraph.py`, which we can utilize in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we want to use reinforcement learning to create an algorithm that can identify which devices are likely to be malicious, so that we can avoid them when transmitting data through the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is based off of Dr. Abdelhakim's work: *Identifying Malicious Nodes in Multihop IoT Networks using Diversity and Unsupervised Learning* (2018)."

We use a partial mesh topology to define the network, which means that not all pairs of nodes are directly connected to each other (which would be a full mesh topology).

    "* `edge_prob` - how likely it is that any two devices in the network are connected. `Edge_prob = 1` means that every device is connected to every other device; this isn't useful for this study, as we want to learn about the paths from one device to another. However, we want the graph to be connected; that is, there does exist at least one path from one device to another. For this reason, we generally start with a low `edge_prob`, then make use of a method to add edges to the network until it is connected. This will result in a sparse, but connected, graph.\n",
